## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. In the img folder, you will find additional images not used in the tuturial. You can add additional obstacles such as the bird or the bigger cactus. You can also add a feature for the chrome dinosaur to duck. Another feature you can add is keeping track of the high score every time the player resets the game.
